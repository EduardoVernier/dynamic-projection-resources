# Quantitative Evaluation of Time-Dependent Multidimensional Projection Techniques

Dimensionality reduction methods are an essential tool for multidimensional data analysis, and many interesting processes can
be studied as time-dependent multivariate datasets. There are, however, few studies and proposals that leverage on the concise
power of expression of projections in the context of dynamic/temporal data.

In this study, we present an evaluation of 9 methods, 10 datasets and 12 quality metrics and elect the best suited methods for
projecting time-dependent multivariate data, exploring design choices and characteristics of each method.

This website and accompanying repository (https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dynamic-projections) contain all the resources generated
during this project along with all the code, data and instructions needed to replicate our results.
